= Sabacc House Rules

== The Deal

Players place antes to the main pot and the sabacc pot.
Dealer shuffles the deck gives three down cards and one up card to each player.
The dealer lays seven cards on the board.
One of the board cards is the discard pile.

== The Hand

The hand consists of three rounds of betting, drawing, and spikes.
Then there's a final fourth betting round.

=== Betting Phase

Betting is modeled after the ante/bring-in system in stud poker. 
It is fixed-limit betting with a max of one bet plus four raises.
The first two betting rounds are small bet and last two are big bet size.

The first betting round has a mandatory bring-in bet from the player with the highest absolute value face-up card.
If there's a tie, positive number pays bring-in and after that whichever one is left of the dealer.

=== Draw Phase

Buy board card
Draw from the stub
Stay

=== Spike Phase

Doubles: Players muck pocket cards and dealer replaces with same number of cards
Spikes: All players cards are mucked and replaced


== The Showdown

Last aggressor shows their hand first.
Best hand takes the main pot.
Winner takes the sabacc pot if it's Banthas Wild or better.
